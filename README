Stickman program depenencies
============================
To run the program, we need python3 and the following python packages
tkinter

To start the program use the command below
========================================
python3 Movement_of_Stickman.py 

How to Play the game 
===================
The movement of the stickman is decided by three keys - the left key, right key and the space bar.
 On pressing the left arrow key the stickman moves to the left 
 On pressing the right arrow key the stickman moves to the right
 On pressing the space bar the stickman jumps up.
when the stickman falls off from one of the platforms it will land on either a platform in its path or on the ground.
The main objective of the game is to make the stickman reach the door at the top leftmost corner of the window.

Program description
===================

Tkinter coordinates 

(0,0)    ----------  (0,500)
           |           |
           |           |
           ---------- 
(500,0)            (500,500)

The stickman starts at (200, 470) which is in the middle on the floor.

The stickman is always moving till he is blocked by an obstruction. An obstruction is the walls of the game, the floor, the ceiling and the 9 platforms. The platforms are at various heights on the game. 

The algorithm checks if the stickman lands on the platform or is blocked by the platform.           

When the stickman is moving right, the x position of the stickman is increased by a delta of 2 every 10 milli second. The delta is made zero when he reaches an obstacle (platform or a wall). 

When stickman jumps up, it moves 20 times by a step of four and then starts falling off till it lands on a platform or the floor.

When the stickman reaches the door, the game is complete. The door is also an obstacle and when the stickman reaches the obstacle, the game is declared over.

Program Design
===============
The class diagram is also available in the repo

The game class has an array of sprite classes. 
Inheritence
The sprite class uses inheritance. The sprite class is the base class and it has 3 child classes, the platform sprite, the stickman sprite and the door sprite. 

Polymorphism
The platform sprite and door sprite cannot move and so the move function does nothing. The move of the stickman sprite does all the movements. Polymorphism is used here.

All the sprite has coordinates and is has associated coords class.

The game class has all the sprites and implements the mainloop function which is the starting point of the game.
